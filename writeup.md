## Reading Comprehension Questions
All answers can be found in the README.md file

**1. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?**

Git is the distributed control system that is used for coding, keeping track of any changes made on projects, and having the ability go back to older versions of the projects to make new edits. Github is like the website as a whole that is being used to create projects and maintain history of any changes or works created. 

**2. Explain what "committing and pushing" means in your own words. Why are these steps important?**

Committing means saving the changes that the individual has made on a project, keeping it locally for only those who have access to it, in which they can also write a message to remind themselves on what they need to finish or what is in progress. Pushing means sharing the changes with other people online on GitHub so they can see the work. These steps are important because they help keep a record of the progess in the projects and save our work carefully without having the risk to restart.

**3. What is a repository and what does it contain?**

A repository is like a "project folder", which I see it as a way to keep track of assignments or projects that I've worked on independently or with my group members. It contains all of my project's files, codes, and revision history.

## Looking Ahead

**What aspect of AI are you most excited to learn about this year? Explain why.**

I'm excited to learn more about how chatbots are created because I'm interested in computers having the ability to understand the instructions you've given it and communicate with you like a human being would. Especially since in this modern era, there is so many chatbots for online stores, social apps like snapchat, or even google itself that are created to assist the individual in a faster way, without having them to search for the answer. It amazes me how it only takes a few seconds for a chatbot to process and answer your question or help you with a task. Lastly, I want to learn it to figure out how technology is evolving quickly and becoming part of our daily lives.
